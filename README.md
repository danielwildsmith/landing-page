## About
This project was a good test of my new CSS and flexbox skills. The goal of the TOP assignment was to recreate a given webpage template from scratch. After recreating the template, I decided to personalize it, making it a 'weekly book newsletter.'   
  
Overall, a fun project. I'm surprised how it already looks close to real, modern websites. Lacking functionality of course; but that comes soon, with learning JavaScript next!
